# Deep Learning Optimization

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models and optimization techniques, focusing on improving accuracy and reducing training time. The project explores different architectures and algorithms, enabling experimentation and application to various tasks.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: For image recognition and classification.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: For sequential data like text or time-series.
  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: An advanced RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies.
  - **Autoencoders**: For dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction.
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: For generating synthetic data (e.g., images).

- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - Algorithms like **Adam**, **SGD**, and **RMSProp**.
  - Methods to prevent overfitting: **Dropout**, **Batch Normalization**, and **Regularization**.

- **Data Processing**:
  - Loading datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).
  - Preprocessing: normalization, data augmentation, and batching.

- **Metrics and Visualization**:
  - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Graphs for loss and accuracy during training and validation.
